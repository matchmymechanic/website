            What to do?
            Find out the major pain points of the repair process.
            Creating a way to democratize the data involved; The symptoms, The cost, and the time it takes.
            If these components are done then we might have a fighting against this arcane industry. 
            By getting the symptoms of a repair we will be able to do some self diagnosing that is better than a haphazard google search.
            By getting the cost we can better understand the average cost that everyone does a specified repair for a be better prepared with the bill.
            Lastly, by getting the time it takes we can better understand if there is a true delay with a repair.
